### Mission and history

FreeGeek Chicago is a not-for-profit community organization that recycles used computers and parts to provide functional computers, education, internet access and job skills training to those who want them.

FreeGeek Chicago was founded in August 2005 as a collaboration of NPOTechs and Logan Square CTC to recycle computer technology and provide low- and no-cost computing to economically disadvantaged individuals and not-for-profit and social change organizations. FreeGeek Chicago does most of this work with volunteers, who disassemble the donated equipment and test the components, which are either recycled as electronic scrap or reused in refurbished systems.

FreeGeek Chicago is a democratically run organization that uses consensus for decision-making. Our policy decisions are made by a group of volunteers and staff called the council, and those policies are executed by our staff collective. Public meetings are posted on the calendar and discussed on the FreeGeek Talk mailing list.

We are proud to be an affiliate of FreeGeek Portland, the founding FreeGeek.
